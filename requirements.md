# Project Requirements Document

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a personalized educational app that allows students to learn topics from their favorite characters or heroes. The app will:

- Allow students to upload an image of their chosen character.
- Generate a 3D avatar or animated model of the character.
- Enable the character to teach selected topics using AI-generated explanations and voice.
- Provide real-time interaction with the character.
- Save chat history for later review.

---

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Registration and Authentication
- Users can sign up and log in using email or social media accounts.
- Users can create and manage their profiles.

### 2. Topic Selection
- Users can select a topic or subject to learn (e.g., Java, Math, History).
- Topics are categorized by grade level or difficulty.

### 3. Character Selection and Avatar Generation
- Users can upload an image of their favorite character.
- The app generates a 3D avatar or animated model from the uploaded image.
- Users can customize the avatar (e.g., clothing, accessories).

### 4. AI-Powered Teaching
- The app uses conversational AI to explain topics in a simple and engaging manner.
- The AI responds to user questions in real-time.

### 5. Voice Cloning and Text-to-Speech
- The app generates a voice that mimics the character's voice.
- The AI's explanations are converted into speech using text-to-speech (TTS).

### 6. Lip-Syncing
- The avatar's lip movements are synced with the generated audio.

### 7. Real-Time Interaction
- Users can interact with the avatar in real-time using a chat interface.
- The avatar responds with gestures and facial expressions.

### 8. Chat History
- Conversations and lessons are saved for later review.
- Users can revisit past lessons or continue where they left off.

### 9. Gamification
- Add quizzes, rewards, and progress tracking to keep users engaged.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- The app should respond to user inputs within 2-3 seconds.
- Real-time interactions should have minimal latency.

### 2. Scalability
- The app should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- The backend should scale horizontally to accommodate growth.

### 3. Security
- User data (e.g., images, chat history) should be encrypted.
- The app should comply with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, COPPA).

### 4. Usability
- The app should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- The app should be accessible on both mobile and desktop devices.

### 5. Cost
- Use open-source tools and APIs to minimize costs.
- Optimize resource usage to reduce cloud hosting expenses.

  - User authentication.
  - Avatar generation.
  - Voice cloning.
  - Conversational AI.
  - Chat history storage.

### 2. Set Up the Frontend
- Create a Next.js or React Native app.
- Build pages for:
  - User registration and login.
  - Topic selection.
  - Avatar upload and customization.
  - Learning interface with chat and avatar.

### 3. Integrate AI/ML Tools
